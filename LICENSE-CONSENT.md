## Consent to re-license the codebase under the MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses

Parts of the [solx](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx) repository are currently licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).  
The GPL-3.0 is required because the project is statically linked to a modified version of the [Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) hosted at <https://github.com/matter-labs/era-solidity>, which is also released under GPL-3.0.

In the future, the code in this repository may no longer link to libraries that carry a copyleft license.  
If that happens, we intend to re-license **all** code in this repository under the permissive MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses.

To make such re-licensing possible, we need every contributor to give explicit permission for their past and future contributions to be sublicensed under MIT and Apache-2.0.
