# Optimizing Solidity Compiler

**solx** is a new optimizing compiler for EVM developed by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/).

> [!WARNING]  
> The project is in pre-alpha state and not suitable for production use.

**solx** passes [our test suite](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-tester), which includes:

- [tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests) from the **solc** project
- [real-world projects](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-tests/tree/main/solidity/complex/defi) such as UniswapV2 and Mooniswap
- [additional tests](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-tests/tree/main/solidity) written by the **solx** team

Our pool of tests is updated with every **solc** release. Arbitrary contracts are expected to compile correctly, but some may be temporary affected by stack-too-deep errors. Benchmarks indicate that **solx** generates larger code than **solc**, but reduces the gas consumption on average.

Our mid-term goals:

- support EOF
- further reduce gas usage and bytecode size
- eliminate the need for inline assembly for efficiency
- emit [ethdebug](https://ethdebug.github.io/format/index.html) for optimized code
- run more tests of real-life projects in CI

## Installation

You can download the existing pre-releases from the [Releases](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases) GitHub page.
Or, you can take a build used in our [solx_demo](https://github.com/popzxc/solx_demo):

- [MacOS](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases/download/d5a98e5/solx-macosx)
- [Linux/AMD64](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases/download/d5a98e5/solx-linux-amd64-gnu)
- [Linux/Arm64](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases/download/d5a98e5/solx-linux-arm64-gnu)

## Usage

We recommend using **solx** via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). It behaves the same way as
**solc** v0.8.29, so you can download the executable and specify:

```toml
[profile.solx]
solc_version = "/path/to/solx"
```

It might work with **Hardhat** as well, but it has not been tested yet.

Otherwise, the interface is mostly compatible with **solc**, so you can use it via CLI or standard JSON.

## Demo

Check out [this repository](https://github.com/popzxc/solx_demo) to see a demo of the current state of the compiler.

## Architecture

**solx** consists of three main parts:

1. **solx** executable from this repository. The repository also contains parts of the compiler front end: Yul and EVM assembly lowering.
2. [era-solidity](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-solidity/), an LLVM-friendly fork of [the Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity),
  that emits Yul and EVM assembly for **solx**. Despite the repository name, it is not directly related to either ZKsync or ZKsync Era.
3. [era-compiler-llvm](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm), a fork of [the LLVM project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)
  with an EVM target developed by the **solx** team.

The most important part of the project is the EVM target in LLVM. You can find its sources [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-llvm/tree/main/llvm/lib/Target/EVM).

## Documentation

**solx** documentation is provided as an [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), and its sources available in the `docs/` directory.
To build the book, follow the [instructions](./docs/README.md).

See also:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
- [LLVM Documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/)

## Testing

To run the unit and CLI tests, execute `cargo test` at the repository root.

## Troubleshooting

If you have multiple LLVM builds in your system, ensure that you choose the correct one to build the compiler.
The environment variable `LLVM_SYS_170_PREFIX` sets the path to the directory with LLVM build artifacts, which typically ends with `target-llvm/build-final`.
For example:

```shell
export LLVM_SYS_170_PREFIX="${HOME}/src/solx/target-llvm/build-final"
```

If you suspect that the compiler is not using the correct LLVM build, check by running `set | grep LLVM`, and reset all LLVM-related environment variables.
